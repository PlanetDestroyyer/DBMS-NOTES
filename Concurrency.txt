In  a multiple programming env where multiple transactions can be executed simultaneously, it is highly important to control the concurrency .
We have concurrency control protocols to ensure atomicity, isolation and serializability of concurrent transactions. 
concurrencycontrols protocols can be nroadly divided into two catergories :-

1) Lock Based protocols :
Database Systems equipped with lock based protocols use a mechanism by which any transactions cannt read pr write data until it accquires an appropriate lock on it . 
Locks are of Two Kinds,

A)Binary Locaks - A lock on a data item can be in two states, it is either locked or unlocked.

B)Shared/ Exclusive - This Type of Locking mechanism differentiates the locks on their users. 
If a lock is accquired on a data item to perform a write operation, it is Exclusive lock. 
Allowing more than one transactions to write on the same data item would lead the Database into an inconsistent state.
Read locks are shared beacuse no data value is being changed.


2) Time stamp  Based protocols :

A) The most commonly used concurrency protocols is the timestamp based protocols. 
This protocols uses either Systems tiem or logiacl counter as a timestamp.

B) Lock Based protocols manage the order between the conflicing pairs amomg transactions at the time of excetion whereas timestamp based protocols start working as soon as transactions is created.

C) Every transactions has a timestamp associated with it and ordering is determined by the age of the transaction. 
A transaction created at 0002 clock time would be older than all other transactions that come after it .For exmaple , any transaction 'Y' entering the Systemsat 004 is two seconds younger and the priority would be given to the older one.

D) In additon every data item is given the latest read and write-timestamp.This lets the system knos when the last read and write operation was performed on the data item.
