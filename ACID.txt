ACID - Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability

Atomicity :
By this , we mean that either the entire transaction take place at once or doesnt happen at all . 
There is no midway i.e. transaction do not sccour Partially.
 Each Transaction is considered as one unit and either runs to completion or is not executed at all.
 It involves the following two operatios.
1) Abort : if a transaction aborts changes made to database are not visible
2) Commit : If a transaction commits , changesmade are visible

Atomicity is known as the "All or Nothing rule".

Consistency :
This mean that integrity contraints must be maintained so that the database is consistent before and after the transaction . 
It refers to teh correctness of a database. 

Isolation : This Property ensures that multiple transaction can occur concurrently without leading to the incosistency of database state
1) Transaction occues independently without interference
2)Changes occurring in a particular transaction will not be visible to any other Transaction until that particular change in that transaction is written to memory or has been committed
3)This Property ensures that the execution of transaction concurrently will result in a staet that is equivalent to a state achieved there were excuted serially in some order

Durability :
This Property ensures that once the transaction has completed execution, the updates and modifications to that database are stored in and writen to disk and they persist even if a system failure occus . 
These updates now become permanent and are stored in non-volatile memory. The effects of the transaction, thus are never lost.

The ACID Properties in totality provide a mechanism to ensure correctness and Consistency os a database in a wat sych that each transaction is a group of operatios that acts a single unit, produces consistent result, acts in Isolation from other operatios and updates that it makes are durably stored.
